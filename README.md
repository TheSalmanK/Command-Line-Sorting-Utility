# Command Line Sorting Utility
In today's world, data is growing at an unprecedented rate, making it increasingly challenging to process and make sense of the vast amounts of words and numbers. This project aims to provide a solution by developing a program that processes textual and numeric data, sorting it efficiently to help users better understand and analyze it.

The Sorting Tool program is designed to determine the largest or most frequent pieces of data and perform the necessary calculations on them. With this tool, users can easily manage and explore their datasets, revealing valuable insights and patterns.

#Key Features:

- Process textual and numeric data
- Sort data by size or frequency
- Perform calculations on the data to reveal insights
- Handle a variety of input formats, including files and standard input
- Harness the power of the Sorting Tool and dive into the world of data, making sense of it all and uncovering new possibilities!
